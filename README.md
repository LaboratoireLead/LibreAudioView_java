if at the first launch of the application, it closes, it is because your smartphone is blocking access to the camera. To set this go to settings, applications, LibreAudioView, Permissions and allow camera.

The System LibreAudioView uses openCv librairies. There are two different ways to use openCv.
Librairies can be use statically or we ask to dowload the application opencv Manager.
By default the system uses static libraries. You can change it simply in the MainActivity as explained in comments.
